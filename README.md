- 👋 Hi, I’m @anupmistry123
- 👀 I’m interested in all forms of SQL (particularly dynamic SQL), Python (for automation and data analysis) and VBA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust as I want to learn a different language which requires stricter code writing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of SQL, Python or VBA project. I'm always keen to learn more and also share my ideas.
- 📫 Reach me on anupmistry123@gmail.com, +447877301447 (Whatsapp and Telegram) or via my LinkedIn profile www.linkedin.com/in/anupmistry123.
